For testing purposes in Milestone-3 with postman, the resource/user/2factor service only asks for the first 2fa word so
the postman test where a user must be logged in work correctly. Otherwise postman would have to guess which of the
5 words is asked for, or I would have had to find a solution which probably would have been much more complicated.

Note:
The logic in the code for this won't be uploaded to git and was only made temporarily.
